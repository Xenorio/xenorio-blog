I always have been interested in having a VPN connection always ready to go. Not, as most plug&play VPN providers will tell you, to protect myself from "hackers" with military-gradeâ„¢ encryption (which is bullshit, that's what SSL already does a great job at) or to circumvent geo-blocking of streaming services (believe it or not, i do not own a Netflix account).

The actual use of VPNs, at least for me, are more related to general data protection. Maybe it's just me, but when i visit a website i don't want it to map my (rough) location in some analytics dashboard. 

Also, in recent times, the german government (which i live under) started implementing more and more restrictions of the internet, under the disguise of "copyright and child protection". To be fair, this has not affected me yet as they're only doing DNS blocks (the first thing i do when i get a new router is change the DNS server it uses) but they're getting more aggressive every day which prompts me to stop trusting my ISP.

The only people i trust less than my ISP are random VPN companies tho (not dropping names). They keep pushing false advertising, use proprietary software, and flat out lie in their privacy policies. But recently, i became the SysAdmin of the very server you received this blog post from, so i decided to just be my own VPN provider!

## The search for technology
The first thing you need to do when setting something up is decide which software you want to use. Not knowing what the standard in "VPNing" is, i decided to just look at the integrated options of my network manager.

Soo... openconnect? That says something about Cisco and Juniper stuff, seems very enterprise-y, probably not for me.

OpenVPN? I've heard of that! Free, open source, GPL licensed, gotta keep that in mind!

PPTP? Says "compatible with Microsoft" directly under it. Sorry, no.

SSH? You can set up a VPN with that? *furious internet searching* Daaamn, looks like a plug&play job, definitely worth looking at!

"Cisco compatible VPN"? Naaaah...

So, at the end i decided to have a deeper look into OpenVPN and SSH.

## SSH Shenanigans
Using SSH seemed like the easiest solution to me. i mean, i'm already using SSH with the server, so it shouldn't be **that** hard, right? Well, it depends.

After searching around for what seemed like an eternity, i arrived at 2 options. Local port forwarding, and dynamic port forwarding. 

The local kind can apparently be used to tunnel just one specific port through the server, can't use that for my purposes, i want everything.

Dynamic port forwarding however sets up a SOCKS proxy running on your local machine, and any traffic going through there gets tunneled. That's more like it! i can make that work!

So, with high anticipation, i entered ``ssh -N -D 1080 xenorio@xenorio.xyz`` (which is supposed to start the proxy on port 1080 and not run a shell) into my terminal, pressed enter, aaaaand:

After more furious searching, i found out that the ``PermitTunnel`` config entry of sshd needs to be enabled on the server. Whoops.

Changed that, retried, and suddenly it seemed to do something! Looks to be connected! Alright, let's go into network settings and set the proxy to ``127.0.0.1:1080``. Opened [ipv4.icanhazip.com](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com) with my browser aaaand success! It displays the IP of the server!

Alright, just gonna add to ``~/.profile`` so the proxy starts automatically, and make it an infinite loop so it restarts when something crashes. Re-logged to make that run, checked my IP again, and everything seemed to work great! Now i can finally rest knowing that everything just works!

Oh no. Oh god. Sound the alarms! Internet is borked! What happened???

Welp, i had my daily IP reset (thanks, german ISPs) which interrupted the SSH connection. This didn't seem to make the proxy stop tho, so the loop i implemented didn't restart it. Meaning that unless i fix that, i need to manually restart this every day. Do i know how to go about fixing this? No. Did the internet provide me with anything? Also no. Do i want to put in the work to figure this out myself? Naaaah. So, i decided to escort the SSH idea to the dumpster.

## VPN 2: Eletric Boogaloo - OpenVPN
From my earlier excursions into the depths of DuckDuckGo, i stumbled upon [openvpn-install](https://github.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install) which is supposed to automatically set up a secure OpenVPN server. Seems great, don't wanna accidentally leave a backdoor open or something.

So i downloaded the script, ran it, and went through the setup wizard thingy. Worked like a charm. It put a .ovpn file into my home directory, which apparently contains all the client config i need. Could not be more easy! Downloaded that file, remembered to open port 1194 in the firewall (always almost forgetting this), ran ``openvpn3 session-start --config ./xenorio.ovpn`` to connect, aaaand connection refused. Frick.

Looking at the server logs, i saw that OpenVPN cried about not being able to access ``/var/log/openvpn`` and ``/etc/openvpn``. So i just chowned that to the openvpn user. No idea why the install script doesn't manage that automatically.

Restarted the OpenVPN server service, tried to connect again, aaand success! I'm in! And everything i do is automatically tunneled!

Now, to test behavior on IP resets, i simulated one by giving my ethernet cable a good ol' replug. And yes, it's still tunneling! Amazing!

## Conclusion
If you want a permanent VPN connection, go with OpenVPN. If you just want to quickly tunnel something for testing purposes or whatever, go with SSH.
