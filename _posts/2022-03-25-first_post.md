# So i set up a blog
Not sure what exactly will appear here. Every time i find or think of something interesting, i'll try to write an article. Probably mostly about coding and tech.

## How did you do this?
This blog uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com
) framework in combination with the [jekyll-dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash) theme.
