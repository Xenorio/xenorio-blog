Recently, I have come in contact with image generating AI models, including [craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/)

Playing around with these is really fun. You just describe what you want to see, and they generate an image based on it out of thin air.

As an example, this is what Midjourney came up with for the prompt "wooden shack, purple, comic style":

Now I think the question on everyones mind is: Will this replace human artists?

I think not. But I think it's a great tool for getting inspiration or something to base your art off of. You can just give it a rough idea of what you're thinking of and get something back that you can expand on manually.

The bigger question, at least for me, is the legal point of view. Who has the copyright on these images? Whoever trained the AI? The person giving it prompts? Is everything just public domain by default? There will probably be some major legal battles to come.

What I do know is that some amazing things will come out of this, especially with further development. Dreaming computers, generated virtual worlds, you name it.
